# üê≥ Triple Whale API Node App

For documentation on available endpoints and request structure, visit [https://developers.triplewhale.com/swagger/index.html](https://developers.triplewhale.com/swagger/index.html)

## ‚ö° Live demos

We have two live demos, both hosted on GCP. The first uses the OAuth flow, and the second uses an API key.

[OAuth Flow Example](https://client-cgrzlhwaka-uk.a.run.app/)

[API Key Example](https://node-api-key-cgrzlhwaka-uk.a.run.app)

## üü° Prerequesites

1. Ensure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), and optionally [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed on your machine
1. Ensure you are using Node 18: `nvm use`
1. Install the `package.json` dependencies: `npm i` or `yarn`
1. Ensure you have a properly formatted `.env` file; an `.env.example` file has been provided

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Choose your own adventure

You can choose to use either the OAuth or API Key example, but not both. When in doubt, listen to the CLI ü§ñ

Your needs should determine which example you use:

1. If you are building a public app, and wish to push and display your own data within Triple Whale, you should use OAuth.

2. If you simply want to pull data from Triple Whale, you should use an API Key.

**NOTE: To be clear, you cannot push or pull your own data from Triple Whale unless you are using OAuth.**

### üÖ∞Ô∏è OAuth

You can obtain your OAuth credentials by visiting [https://developers.triplewhale.com/](https://developers.triplewhale.com/) and creating a new app.

Your `.env` file should contain the following:

```bash
# OAuth
CLIENT_ID=
CLIENT_SECRET=
REDIRECT_URL=
SHOP_URL=
SCOPE=
```

With OAuth, you get access to all the endpoints within the Swagger docs:

- Summary page data - `/api/v2/summary-page/get-data`
- Pixel Attribution V1 (deprecated) - `/api/v2/attribution/get-orders-with-journeys`
- Pixel Attribution V2 - `/api/v2/attribution/get-orders-with-journeys-v2`
- Send custom metrics to TW to display within the summary page - `/api/v2/tw-metrics/metrics-data`
- Recieve custom metrics back from TW - `/api/v2/tw-metrics/metrics`

### üîë API Key

Your `.env` file should contain the following:

```bash
# API Key
SHOP_URL=
SCOPE=
API_KEY=
```

With an API key, you get access to only a limited set of endpoints:

- Summary page data - `/api/v2/summary-page/get-data`
- Pixel Attribution V1 (deprecated) - `/api/v2/attribution/get-orders-with-journeys`
- Pixel Attribution V2 - `/api/v2/attribution/get-orders-with-journeys-v2`

**NOTE: the presence of `API_KEY` in your `.env` file negates the OAuth flow, and will be used instead of the OAuth bearer token.**

## üèÅ Quickstart

```bash
## one-liner
nvm use && yarn && yarn dev
```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Dev server

```bash
## npm
npm run dev

## OR

## yarn
yarn dev
```

## üü¢ Production server

```bash
## build the app
## then run express + vite in production mode
yarn start
```

## üêã Docker

We have included `Dockerfile` and `docker.compose`, which should enable you to host this app in a Docker container.

You can build and run the Docker image with the following commands:

```bash
# Build the image
yarn docker:build

# Run the image
yarn docker:compose
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è GCP Cloud Run

We have also included a `cloudbuild.yaml` file, which should enable you to host this app on GCP Cloud Run.

You can build and run the Cloud Run image with the following commands:

```bash
# Build and deploy
gcloud run deploy
```

## ‚è∏Ô∏è Caveats

This is **not production ready!**

This repository's purpose is to demonstrate interfacing with our API, and is not intended to be used in production.

Thus we use `node-localstorage` to store JWT data, which you will find under the `/scratch` folder. You should be able to drop in your own DB of choice, but we have not tested this yet.

## üò† Common issues

### "I cannot install package.json"

- Ensure you have Node installed on your machine

- Ensure you are using the correct Node version, v18

- Ensure you are in the correct directory, eg: `<YOUR_PC>/triple-whale-public-apis/examples/node`

### "The CLI says I'm missing required data"

- Ensure you have a provided all required data in your `.env` file

### "I cannot complete the oAuth flow"

- Ensure your redirect URL and matches your `.env` file

- Ensure your, Client ID, and Client Secret are correct

### "My API key isn't working"

- Ensure your API key is correct

- Ensure your shop URL is correct

- Ensure you have the correct scope (scopes are wip, so this may not be the issue)

### "I cannot make any requests to the backend"

- Ensure your bearer token has been acquired, is accurate, and is present within your `/scratch` folder (or DB of choice)

- Check steps above

### "My OAuth app isn't approved yet, but I want to ___"

- You cannot interface with the TW API until your app is approved

### "I don't like how you did ___ in this example"

- We're always looking to improve; submit a pull request and we'll gladly review it!

### "Docker isn't working for me"

- Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine
